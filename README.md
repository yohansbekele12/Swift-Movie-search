## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm should be installed. If you don't have them installed, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swift-movie-search.git
   cd swift-movie-search
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   In the root of the project, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up your TMDb API key**:
   - Create an account on [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
   - Go to your [API section](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and generate an API key.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your API key:
     ```
     REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Once the app is running, you can:
  - **Search for movies** by entering a movie name in the search bar.
  - **View movie details** such as the title, release date, and poster.
  - **Click on the movie poster** to get more information about the movie.
  
The app fetches data from the Movie DB API, and you can interact with the UI to search and explore different movies.
